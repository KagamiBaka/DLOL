{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE <title> The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates, European economists said. But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt, according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday. \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid, senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London. But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.\" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday. \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.", "label": " interest rates, money foreign exchange"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS <title> Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a \"package.\" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna. \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.", "label": " crude oil"}

The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people. Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die,\" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.", "label": " sugar"}

He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes. Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said. The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season's available amount, Mielke said. The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said. He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990. Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said. The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm. At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said. Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season. The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said. World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth. Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season.", "label": " sunflower oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, palm oil, vegetable oil"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS <title> Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.", "label": " soybean, oilseed, corn, grain"}

Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said. Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share. Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan. Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.

The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share. It said President Michael R.

The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar securities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But \"if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares,\" said Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department. An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds. \"Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability,\" said Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S. Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning. \"Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,\" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said. Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914. \"Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult, considering the dangers,\" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group. Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING <title> U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session. They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing. \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output. \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil. \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts. \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.", "label": " crude oil"}

December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.", "label": " crude oil"}

At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea,\" he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING <title> A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report. Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year. As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said. Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he added.", "label": " housing, income, gross national product"}

The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs. \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday. \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said one international oil trader in Tokyo. \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,\" he added. One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said. Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast. Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,\" an oil industry analyst said.", "label": " crude oil"}

Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament. He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983. Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln. January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million. Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.

USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said. The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said. In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said. The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago, Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis. The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said.

The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports. Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward. The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously. \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\" The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs. The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979. Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis. The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration. Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures. \"We're considering it,\" he said, \"It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come.\" The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.

He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran. Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, \"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us. \"We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious.

The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks. Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, \"We won't have any comment or response to the Iranian statements.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA <title> European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation. \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said. However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said. \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said. \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said. \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said. \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.", "label": " coffee"}

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels.

Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion at the end of 1986. The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday.

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop. It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness. However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said. The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said. Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said. Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested. During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.

Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, to draw up a paper on the matter. Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes. He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea. Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports. \"Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot see how this would work out in our case,\" Lim said. Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year. The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September. \"Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics,\" Lim said. He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application. Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced. He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited. Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long \"interregnum\" between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force. He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management.", "label": " aluminum, palm oil, vegetable oil, tin"}

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.  Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and \"we may add a bank to that.\" \"We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,\" he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was \"nominal.\" Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. \"We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs,\" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock.  Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said \"you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.\" Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. \"They have not done the right things at the right time,\" he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN <title> Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years, oil industry sources said. Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG, the sources said. They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. \"Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense,\" said one trader. Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia. No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said. \"Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers, which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area,\" said another trader. Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports. Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions, traders said. They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments. Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991. Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said. The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987, the sources said. But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market, they said. Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which 5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said. The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice. Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light. Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP. Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January, the trade sources said. Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement. Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume. \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said an official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments.\" Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to current levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.", "label": " shipping, propane"}

Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said.

The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. \"The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension.

Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was \"insignificant compared with what we are going to earn.\" OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake.

A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital. Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray Astin, that the listings of new \"B\" shares would be barred. The official announcement said this will include the proposal by Jardine Matheson. But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying: \"We continue to believe that the issuing of \"B\" shares would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.\" Keswick said the \"B\" share issue will benefit Jardine Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting existing shareholders' voting rights. However, he added: \"We certainly welcome (the Secretary for Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the development of general principles which can be embraced by all constituents of the Hong Kong market.\"", "label": " earnings"}

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\" \"It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place.\" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading.  Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.", "label": " acquisitions"}

The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14. The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.

On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations, which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits, effective today. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said. Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today. During the last week of April, silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders. The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets. O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would add caution to trading. \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\" O'Neill said.", "label": " aluminum, copper, silver, gold"}

ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\" \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax. The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said. The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December. U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.

Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an increase in outbreaks of the disease.

Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack stores. \"The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,\" said Levy of International Data.  Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent.", "label": " acquisitions"}

In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, \"A gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining Swiss industry.\" \"Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,\" he said.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET <title> The Philippines' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier. \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said. \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive. \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners,\" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups. \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said. \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said. \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"", "label": " gross national product"}
{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS <title> Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\" He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.", "label": " trade"}

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.  The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.  On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.", "label": " interest rates"}

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.", "label": " interest rates"}

But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. \"There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,\" he said. \"We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a \"slight firming\" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. \"The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,\" he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. \"And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress,\" he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. \"You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,\" he said.", "label": " money foreign exchange"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET <title> European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October. Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.", "label": " tin"}

Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax. A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual, Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or 4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs. Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest income by 1.5 mln dlrs. Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from 3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's cost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from 27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs from 26.2 mln. Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5 mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said. The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7 mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with 594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier. Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35 billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of March, 1986.", "label": " earnings"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED <title> Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.", "label": " soybean, oilseed, wheat, sunflower seed, sorghum, corn, grain"}

President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.", "label": " trade"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY <title> Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said. A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.  Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to support the stock and security markets,\" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said. \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,\" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.", "label": " interest rates"}

He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether. \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root.\" He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop. \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he said. With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said. \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\" he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output. \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said. \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,\" Romero said. He said the government's proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land. \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won't happen,\" he said. PCA figures show about one-third of the country's population is dependent on the coconut industry. Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land.", "label": " coconut oil, palm oil, meal feed, copra cake, coconut, vegetable oil"}

The central bank's statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August. Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to close at 1,803.08.", "label": " money foreign exchange"}

I was expecting something more than that,\" said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company. Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: \"The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again.\" The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington. After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels. The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading. \"They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?,\" asked Republic's Cohen. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February. Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range. Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments. Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen. The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.", "label": " japanese yen"}

By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing. \"Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,\" he said. The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S. Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added. Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. \"We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,\" Zimmerman said. \"If we're an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,\" he added.

The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.", "label": " trade"}

Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share.\" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston Purina Co &lt;RAL>. \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he said.  Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial adviser.", "label": " acquisitions"}

But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S. plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S. Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood. Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle, one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review. USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review. Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft petition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule, but that \"the chances of that are not too good at this time.\" However, there is the \"expectation\" in U.S. government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the USTR official said.", "label": " livestock, carcass"}

The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit \"could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.\" It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion. \"The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,\" it said. While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect. The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last. In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth. Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986. \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said. The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said. In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.

The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig.

Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said. On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions. During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses. The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.

Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said. Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.  Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards. Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s. Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.  Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said. The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year.  Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said. Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.", "label": " natural gas, crude oil"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US <title> Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker. The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes. But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. \"Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,\" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"It's like a Greek tragedy,\" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank. Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday. Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape. \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said. \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes.", "label": " shipping, crude oil"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS <title> A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.", "label": " acquisitions"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT <title> Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said. But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans. \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export profits. \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel.", "label": " copper"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY <title> Four of West Germany's five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation. But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability. The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct. The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy. Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said. \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,\" they said. The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said. The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates. \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said. A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations. The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account. Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability. The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the falling mark.", "label": " gross national product, consumer price index, money supply"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND <title> The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said. He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered. Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week. \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April 23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this. Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users. He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation. Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing. Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said. Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah. Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.", "label": " rubber, coffee, lumber, palm oil, vegetable oil"}

It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,\" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism, Lyng said \"The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.\" \"I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.\" Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations  started. \"All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,\" Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.", "label": " vegetable oil, soybean, trade"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES <title> Steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts. But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits. \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already.\" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>. \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way,\" he said. \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it,\" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales come from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for,\" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\" he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than negatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.", "label": " iron and steel"}

Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835 billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986. The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May, with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion. \"Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance between the purchase and sale of foreign securities,\" the statement added.

Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency. The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff. Synar said, \"the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis.\" Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war.

Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector. \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.", "label": " soybean, oilseed, corn, grain, carcass, livestock, rice, trade"}

Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\" Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\" Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers. He said he did not think Japan would retaliate. \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,\" Yeutter said. He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.\" Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but \"I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.\"", "label": " trade"}

Eighty-one pct of the membership voted,\" he said. The union representative said that the pact offered cost of living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but contained no wage increase. The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he said. The three locals cover about 2,600 production and maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley, B.C. lead-zinc mine. Output at both sites has been shut down since the production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office and technical workers, went on strike May 9. The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and technical workers have not negotiated since May 21. The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which means the company may not be able to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine. Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar. The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job classifications. The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver, produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter. The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium. Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.", "label": " strategic metals, lead, zinc"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING <title> Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said. High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States. \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said. \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\" The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?\" But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said. \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said. \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought. \"They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.", "label": " money foreign exchange, interest rates"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY <title> Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year. The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. \"Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory.\"", "label": " trade"}

Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan. Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow. \"Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its operations,\" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies.

It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,\" said the official who asked not to be named. He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes. The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag. Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied, \"I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower.\" The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement of the U.S. attack.", "label": " shipping"}

A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products. But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. \"I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation,\" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.

It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION <title> Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies. In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements. \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect. \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term,\" Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP. \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem. A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said. Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said. In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.", "label": " money foreign exchange, interest rates"}

The move is designed by the government to improve India's trade deficit. Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services. The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product. RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings. These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores. RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.

As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy. \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report. \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said.

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms. \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said. \"Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said. \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.", "label": " trade"}

Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\" The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime. \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.", "label": " vegetable oil"}

Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20. Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year. Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said. \"We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption,\" Showa Shell said. Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said. High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total gasoline sales in Japan, it added. Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100. Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales. The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years. \"Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas,\" an official at a major oil company said. An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness. Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil, Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.

Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\" In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.", "label": " sugar"}

David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.", "label": " acquisitions"}

The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'  economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\" The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\" REUTER^M", "label": " gross national product"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS <title> Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas. \"In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,\" Suharto said. \"Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,\" he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration. \"As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,\" Subroto said. \"The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis.\" Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. \"This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.\" Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested.", "label": " crude oil"}

The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in its final ruling on the matter. Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator said. The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer -- Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S. supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986, the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said. Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said. An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22. Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties, Vastagh said. He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters, including three major shippers, would be affected by the decision.", "label": " orange"}

Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said. \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\" Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.", "label": " coffee"}

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters. \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious.\" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE <title> Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said. Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987, analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies. In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a Brooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through to rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings, end-users, especially residential and commercial customers, will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, high cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>, Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering firm, said. \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge, he said. \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may take a while.\"", "label": " natural gas"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY <title> Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said. MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said. \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source. \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said. \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said. \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said. \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.", "label": " trade, acquisitions"}

Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms and setting them ablaze. The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from the Rostam field soon after. At least one of the other two targets was also believed to be ablaze, the sources said. The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack. Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway. U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON <title> Major U.S. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said. In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. That spread has narrowed again. \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements. \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\" said Jones of Lanston. \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point.\" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end. \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately. Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.", "label": " money foreign exchange, interest rates"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS <title> Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability. Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets. \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"If they do, it's not evident.\" \"It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be. \"One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies,\" as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. \"I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's happening,\" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand. At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick. The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher. Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals.", "label": " silver, gold, livestock, cotton, grain, money foreign exchange"}

September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August. Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period. Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said. The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach 10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and 15.4 billion dlrs of imports.

Dealers said the communique early in the European morning from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day. The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday's last 1.8365/75. Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22. Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as \"soft as wax.\" Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present. Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may be under consideration. German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70 pct after 3.80 yesterday. Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct. But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger said, \"since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.\" Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct. Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night.

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. \"However, that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,\" Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain. \"We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency, has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,\" Pex said. \"It is only with great regret that we have taken this route, but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option even though it could take years,\" Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.

The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents. It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year. It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy. The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs. South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986.

Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591 mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln dlrs in the first week of the period. Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of 447 mln dlrs. A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in the week ended Wednesday. Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for 65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90 pct of the borrowing. Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.

Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning. Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents. \"What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and when that happens, everybody sees it,\" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc. Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which produces about 80 pct of that state's crop. The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. \"That's hurricane force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the West Texas area, probably less than five pct,\" Mohler said. \"No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been worse,\" Mohler said. About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.

Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year.

Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow. \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986. \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said. The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs. The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said. \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said. Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said. He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\" The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.", "label": " balance of payments"}

The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said. \"It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,\" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.

Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, \"There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.\" Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY <title> With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today. The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago. \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.", "label": " trade"}

Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion. Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues. But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of \"subdued optimism,\" particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents. \"Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded,\" he said. German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December. Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987. Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting. Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, \"Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.\" Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington.", "label": " interest rates, money foreign exchange"}
{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD <title> OPEC has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said. They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December. \"There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in effect putting pressure on end-users,\" a European crude oil trader said. In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, \"There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, \"We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly.\" Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark crude, they expect price increases over the next few days. August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42. Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least. They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months. They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October. Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added. \"There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,\" said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish, \"For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat.\" A Singapore trade source said, \"There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages.\" Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level, after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish factor to be considered. Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement. Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest. Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies, dealers said.", "label": " naphtha, fuel, crude oil"}

They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington. \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat. Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf. The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said. Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was \"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\" The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection. Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq. Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz. The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said. A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait. \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one. Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf. Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran. Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself. Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets. Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.", "label": " crude oil, shipping"}

He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord. The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of \"dynamic\" moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers. These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC sources said.

U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. \"We consider the matter closed,\" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate. Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests. Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a \"crushing blow.\" \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran. Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said. \"The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,\" a diplomat said. President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued. Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran. \"It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,\" one diplomat said. \"This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait.\" Commented another diplomat: \"Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep.\" One source said of the attack on the oil platform: \"They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody.\" A diplomat commented: \"They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place.\" A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: \"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ...

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY <title> A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves. Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth. \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\" the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct. Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market.", "label": " deutsche mark, dutch florin, money foreign exchange, interest rates"}

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,\" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said.", "label": " money foreign exchange"}

One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.", "label": " cocoa"}

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES <title> More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates. And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds. \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans. \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product.\" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years.", "label": " interest rates"}

The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production. CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.", "label": " coffee"}

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a \"good meeting\" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including an \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate.

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985.

Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. \"As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region,\" Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere. He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war. Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack. Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration.", "label": " shipping"}

It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said. Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5 pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said. The three locals represent about 2,600 production and maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about 600 office and technical workers. The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine. Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar. The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver, produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES <title> The head of Spain's employers' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government's monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment. He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said. High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said. Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987. To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986. Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987. These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations. He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling. Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance.

{"text": "Classify the following Reuters economic and trade news as the correct topic: <title> ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY <title> Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding, \"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones.\" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern. \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.", "label": " earnings, acquisitions, crude oil, petrochemicals"}

The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S. \"These are quota items, and the principles that apply to them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,\" Lyng told Reuters in an interview. He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31, next year. The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some cheeses and specialty fruit juices. U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman. The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers. \"We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said. He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.", "label": " carcass, trade"}

Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and currency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures. The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention, he said.", "label": " interest rates"}

Conger said, \"the move to consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's acquistions policy.\" Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120 mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said. Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6 pct. Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces. However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems.
